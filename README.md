# Diego Vallarino
Welcome to my space! 

As a Ph.D. in Cliometrics, MSc degrees in Statistics and other in Data Management, an MBA full time specializing in quantitative finance, and a double degree in Business and Accounting, I possess a diverse set of skills for conducting sophisticated quantitative research / analysis in the realms of finance and information services.

Cliometrics (an economic branch that utilizes economic theory and quantitative methods to analyze historical data), Econometrics and Statistics also feature prominently in my repertoire. These disciplines share a fundamental characteristic: the analysis of data to uncover meaningful insights and the application of statistical techniques for data processing and interpretation. Rooted in quantitative methodologies, these fields harness the power of mathematical and statistical models to drive analysis.

Join me as we explore the world of economics and quantitative analysis, employing rigorous methods and statistical tools to delve into data, and extract valuable insights.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or recommendations. Good reading!
